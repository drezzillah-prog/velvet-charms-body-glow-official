      <h2>About Velvet Charms</h2>
      <p>
        Velvet Charms is a small, independent studio focused on handcrafted pieces made with care,
        patience, and attention to detail. Each item is created individually — never mass-produced —
        and designed to feel personal, warm, and lasting.

      <h3>How our creations work</h3>
      <p>
        Most of our pieces are <strong>customisable by nature</strong>. You may choose an item exactly
        as shown in the catalogue, or treat it as a starting point for something more personal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Colors and aromas are always included at no extra cost.</strong><br>
        Adjustments such as size, added elements, materials, or entirely new concepts may affect pricing.
