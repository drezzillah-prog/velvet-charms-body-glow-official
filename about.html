    <h2>About Velvet Charms</h2>

    <p>
      Velvet Charms is a small handmade brand focused on cozy, thoughtful creations.
      Each item is crafted with care, patience, and attention to detail — from candles
      and natural soaps to knitted pieces and decorative creations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many of our products are made in small batches, and we also welcome
      <strong>custom commissions</strong>. If you have a specific idea, size, scent,
      color palette, or gift concept in mind, feel free to reach out.
