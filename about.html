  <h2>About Velvet Charms</h2>

  <p>
    Velvet Charms is a small handmade studio creating cozy, thoughtful pieces
    with care, patience, and attention to detail.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our collections include natural candles, artisanal soaps, knitted winter wear,
    body care items, epoxy and clay creations, as well as personalized commissions.
    Every item is made individually or in small batches — never mass-produced.
  </p>

  <h3>Custom orders & commissions</h3>

  <p>
    Many of our pieces can be customized, from subtle adjustments
    to fully bespoke creations. If you have something specific in mind,
    feel free to contact us and tell us your idea.
  </p>

  <h3>Ordering & payment</h3>

  <p>
    Items can be ordered directly from the catalogue and paid for immediately.
    If you request customizations, we first discuss the details together,
    after which you receive a personalized payment link.
  </p>

  <p>
    Custom pieces are created only after payment is completed,
    as they are made specifically for you.
