      <h2>About Velvet Charms</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        Velvet Charms is a small, slow-made studio focused on handcrafted pieces that feel warm, personal,
        and thoughtfully created. From body care and cozy knits to art objects and decorative keepsakes,
        every item is made with care, patience, and attention to detail.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe handmade items should feel special — not mass-produced. That’s why many of our creations
        are made in small batches or individually, allowing room for subtle variation, texture, and character.
      </p>

      <h3>Custom creations are our specialty</h3>

      <p>
        Many Velvet Charms pieces can be customized or commissioned entirely from scratch.
        Whether you have a clear vision or just a feeling you want to capture, we’re happy to collaborate.
      </p>

      <h4>How custom orders work</h4>
      <ol class="process-steps">
        <li>
          <strong>Share your idea.</strong><br>
          Tell us what you have in mind — type of item, preferred materials, approximate size,
          theme, and intended use. You may attach one or more inspiration images if you have them.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Personal touches.</strong><br>
          Colors and aromas (for candles, soaps, and body care) are always included free of charge.
          Other elements — such as size adjustments, added components, or complex detailing —
          may affect the final price.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Design & confirmation.</strong><br>
          We’ll discuss feasibility, timeline, and pricing. Once everything is agreed upon,
          you’ll receive a personalized payment link.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Creation & delivery.</strong><br>
          Your piece is crafted with care and prepared for delivery.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="fine-note">
        Larger or more complex commissions may qualify for a thank-you adjustment,
        which is reflected directly in your personalized payment link.
