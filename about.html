      <h2>About Velvet Charms</h2>

      <p>
        Velvet Charms is a small, slow-made studio focused on handcrafted pieces that feel warm,
        personal, and thoughtfully created. Every item is made with care, patience, and attention
        to detail — never mass-produced.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our collections include body care, candles, cozy knitted wear, and decorative keepsakes.
        Many pieces are created in small batches or entirely made to order, allowing each creation
        to have its own character and individuality.

      <h3>Custom creations & commissions</h3>

      <p>
        Custom work is at the heart of Velvet Charms. You may request personalized versions of
        existing items or commission something entirely new.
      </p>

      <h4>How custom orders work</h4>

      <ol class="process-steps">
        <li>
          <strong>Send your idea.</strong><br>
          Tell us what you’d like to create — item type, size, materials, colors, aromas,
          and intended use. Inspiration images are welcome.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>What’s included.</strong><br>
          Color choices and aromas (for candles, soaps, and body care) are always included
          free of charge.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Pricing.</strong><br>
          Catalogue prices represent the base price. Adjustments such as size changes,
          added elements, or complex detailing may affect the final cost.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Payment.</strong><br>
          Once details are confirmed, you’ll receive a personalized payment link created
          specifically for your order.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Larger or more complex commissions may qualify for a small thank-you adjustment,
        reflected directly in your personalized payment link.
