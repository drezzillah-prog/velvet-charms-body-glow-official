  <h2>About Velvet Charms</h2>

  <p>
    Velvet Charms is a small, slow-made studio focused on handcrafted pieces
    that feel warm, personal, and thoughtfully created.
  </p>

  <p>
    From body care and cozy knits to art objects and decorative keepsakes,
    each item is made with patience, texture, and attention to detail.
