    <h2>About Velvet Charms</h2>

    <p>
      Velvet Charms is a small handmade studio focused on cozy, thoughtful pieces
      created with patience, care, and attention to detail.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our collections include natural candles, artisanal soaps, knitted winter wear,
      body care items, epoxy and clay creations, as well as personalized commissions.
      Every item is made in small batches or individually, never mass-produced.
    </p>

    <h3>Custom orders & commissions</h3>

    <p>
      Many of our pieces can be customized — whether it’s a specific scent, color palette,
      size, or a fully bespoke design. If you have an idea in mind, we encourage you to
      reach out through the Contact page and tell us what you’re looking for.
    </p>

    <h3>Ordering & payment</h3>

    <p>
      Orders are confirmed personally after we discuss the details together.
      Payment is currently accepted via PayPal or bank transfer.
      For custom pieces, a partial advance payment may be required before production begins.
    </p>

    <p>
      This process allows us to ensure clarity, transparency, and a personal connection
      with every order we create.
